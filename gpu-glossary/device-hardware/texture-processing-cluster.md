Generally synonymous with "pair of
[Streaming Multiprocessors](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor)".
Rarely encountered in contemporary discussions of GPUs and not mapped onto a
level of the
[CUDA programming model](/gpu-glossary/device-software/cuda-programming-model)'s
[memory hierarchy](/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy) or
[thread hierarchy](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block), unlike
[Graphics/GPU Processing Clusters](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/graphics-processing-cluster).
